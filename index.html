        <h6>my favourite museum to visit is Hall of Flame Fire Museum </h6>
        <p>The National Historical Fire Foundation (better known as the Hall of Flame Museum of Firefighting) is a museum dedicated to the historical preservation of firefighting equipment used through the years around the world.
            <b>The museum's artifacts were originally the private collection of George F </b>. Getz Jr., who opened the original Hall of Flame in Wisconsin in 1961. The collection relocated to Phoenix in 1974, and has since grown into the world's largest historical firefighting museum.
             <b> museum has five large exhibit galleries, a video theater, and the National Firefighting Hall of Heroes, </b>
             which commemorates U.S. firefighters who have died in the line of duty or have been decorated for acts of heroism. The equipment is grouped as: Gallery One: Hand & Horse Drawn (1725–1908); 
            Gallery Two: Motorized Apparatus (1897–1951); Gallery Three: Motorized Apparatus (1918–1968); Gallery Four: Motorized Apparatus (1919–1950) and a smaller gallery devoted to Wildland Firefighting. It also has a large collection of fire department arm patches, early fire insurance marks, fire helmets, 
            art objects and other types of graphics, as well as a children's play area. </p>
